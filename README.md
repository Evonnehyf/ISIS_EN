R code for a variable selection method when ultra-high dimensionality and high multicollinearity complicate the data analysis simultaneously. Basically, an iterative two-step procedure combining the screening and elastic net regularization.

## Installation
No need to install like an R package. This is an R code modified based on SIS package. You might need to install additional packages for a simple example in R code.
